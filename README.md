* This app was created using a MySQL database, Node, Express, Handlebars, and a homemade ORM. 
Upon opening the web application the user is presented with two columns of burger options. 
The one on the left side is the "Haven't touched" burgers and on the right side is the "Devoured"
burgers. Underneath the two columns is a text area where you can add your own unique burger and
two options to either add it to the "Haven't touched" column or the "Devoured" column. Below these 
two columns is a submit button which users can submit their newly created burger.
